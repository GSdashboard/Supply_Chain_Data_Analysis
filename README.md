# Supply_Chain_Data_Analysis
In this project, I employed Excel to conduct in-depth analysis of supply chain data. My primary focus was on optimizing inventory through the implementation of trend analysis and forecasting techniques. I delved into the intricacies of data to ensure optimal stock levels and minimize costs for a more competitive edge.

Skill Focus: Utilized advanced Excel functions and created a dynamic dashboard in Excel.
